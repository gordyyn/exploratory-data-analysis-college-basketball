Exploratory data analysis of NCAA college basketball data, examining correlations, percentiles, and statistical patterns to uncover unique insights from the dataset. I use Python, matplotlib, NumPy, and the datascience module from Berkeley. 

# NCAA College Basketball Exploratory Data Analysis (2013‚Äì2024)

**Author:** Gordon Yuan  
**Date:** April 12, 2025

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes NCAA college basketball team statistics from 2013 to 2024 using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset includes advanced team metrics such as offensive and defensive efficiency, shooting percentages, turnover rates, and win-loss records. As a basketball fan with limited exposure to the college game, I used this project to explore deeper patterns and fill in gaps in my knowledge of NCAA basketball.

- Which conference has the highest average win percentage?
- Have 2-point and 3-point shooting percentages increased from 2013 to 2024?
- Among the worst teams, which have the highest turnover rates?
- Is there a significant difference in 3-point percentage between strong and weak teams?
